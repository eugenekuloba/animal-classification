<p>Welcome to the Elephant vs. Zebra Image Classification Project README! In this project, we will be training a machine learning model to differentiate between images of elephants and zebras. The goal of this project is to develop a robust image classification system that can accurately distinguish between these two majestic creatures.</p>
