<p>Welcome to the Elephant vs. Zebra Image Classification Project README! In this project, I will be training a machine learning model to differentiate between images of elephants and zebras. The goal of this project is to develop a robust image classification system that can accurately distinguish between these two majestic creatures.</p>

## Project Overview:
***

Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves assigning labels to images based on their content. In my project, I am focusing on distinguishing between two classes: elephants and zebras. This task has real-world applications in wildlife conservation, photography, and more.

## Data Sources:
***
Data was retrieved from the Data Repository for the [`University of Minnesota`], (https://doi.org/10.13020/D6T11K), under a creative commons license, from a study titled: Camera Trap Images used in "Identifying Animal Species in Camera Trap Images using Deep Learning and Citizen Science". All images were downloaded from Zooniverse and have been resized to 330x330 pixels.

## Getting Started:
***

To begin working with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eugenekuloba/animal-classification
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd elephant-zebra-classification
```
3. Set up your Python environment and install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory (data/) following the provided structure.

## Data Preprocessing:
***

Data preprocessing is a critical step in any machine learning project. We will perform the following preprocessing steps:

* Resize images to a consistent size.
* Normalize pixel values.
* Augment the training data with techniques such as random flips and rotations.
